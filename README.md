Virtual Reality is pretty cool to play with. 
Used Unity 3D for creating this project in a college competition TechNext.
This project has a theme of "World Tour" where i have taken a few place's photosphere.
Clicking on different buttons of different places will send the user to the photosphere of that place.
Has background music which is automatically played when user comes in that environmanet.
Includes 3D models prefabs which are embedded in the scene eg: Dancing footballer or Dancing Boy, etc.
